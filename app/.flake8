; .flake8 is the the name of the default flake8 configuration file


; This is the documentation of requirements.dev.txt file
; The reason why we create a new requirements.dev.txt file is because we're going to add a custom step to our build so that we only install these developmet requirements when we're 
; building an image for our local developmet server. The reason we do this is because we don't need tha flake8 package when we're running our deployed application because
; we don't need to run the lintinng tool on the application that we deployed to the server. We only need it for development, so it's useful sometimes to be able to seperate 
; your development dependencies from your actual project dependencies so you don't introduce unnecessary packages into the image that you're deploying on your actual server.

; Go to docker-compose file and add args after context 

; Go to the docker file and write a copy line below copy line for requirements.dev the an ARG above RUN

; Add some logic between  install requirements.txt and rm -rf file in shell scripting language

[flake8]

; It tells flake8 to exclude these following directories and files from the linting and we do migrations because migrations are auto generated by django. So we don't 
; need to lint those and __pycache__ doesn't need to be linted because it's just the cache files that are automatically generated by python and manage.py is a script that 
; follow django.
